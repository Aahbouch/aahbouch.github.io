# High Temperature Computational Studies on CSH

## Project Abstract
This research project focuses on the computational studies of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (CSH) at high temperatures. Our goal is to explore and understand the structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic behavior of CSH when exposed to elevated temperature conditions. The study will employ various computational and modeling techniques, such as Molecular Dynamics (MD), Density Functional Theory (DFT), and Monte Carlo simulations.

## Literature Review
For a deeper understanding of the subject, a literature review has been conducted covering various aspects of high-temperature effects on CSH and computational techniques used in material science. The references have been meticulously organized and stored in the Zotero reference management software for easy access.
