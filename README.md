# High-Temperature Effects on Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates

## Project Abstract
This research project focuses on the computational studies of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) at high temperatures. Our goal is to explore and understand the structural, and mechanical behavior of CSH when exposed to high-temperature conditions. The study will employ Molecular dynamics simulation. some of the input files, data files, and Python codes used for post-processing are also listed above.

## Literature Review
For a deeper understanding of the subject, a literature review has been conducted covering various aspects of high-temperature effects on CSH and computational techniques used in material science. The references have been organized and stored in the Zotero reference management software for easy access.
